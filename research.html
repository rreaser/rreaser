                <p class="paper-meta">With Owen Kay and Reid Taylor</p>
                <p class="paper-abstract-short">After two decades of stagnation, U.S. electricity demand is growing rapidly, driven, in large part, by the proliferation of energy-intensive data centers for Artificial Intelligence (AI) training. We estimate the impact of this load expansion on wholesale electricity generation costs and emissions using a detailed economic dispatch model covering the continental U.S. We estimate that by September 2025, data center load growth was already meaningfully increasing total generation costs relative to a counterfactual world without it. Increases in costs and wholesale prices are driven by the convexity of the aggregate supply curve. As constant, high-utilization data center demand consumes excess generating capacity, the market clears at increasingly steep portions of the curve. As a result, we find that marginal impacts are often the highest during shoulder seasons rather than traditional summer peaks, as data center baseload exacerbates supply tightness during scheduled generator maintenance windows. Our forward-looking simulations suggest these patterns will intensify, which may slow the rate of grid decarbonization by necessitating increased reliance on thermal generation to bridge renewable intermittency.</p>
